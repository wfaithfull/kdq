# EKDQ - Evolution of KDQ Trees

This repository holds some of my recent experiments in relation to an interesting data structure - the *kdq*-tree.
Specifically, I am interested in it's applications for change detection, building on earlier work by [Dasu et al.](http://www.cse.ust.hk/~yike/datadiff/datadiff.pdf)

Please look at the notebook [here](Intro.ipynb)
